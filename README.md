## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Build Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd tomcat-deployment
   ```
2. **Ensure Java 17+ and Maven are installed**
3. **Build the WAR file**
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```
   The WAR file will be generated in the `target/` directory.

## üèóÔ∏è Deploying to Tomcat
1. **Install Tomcat**  
   Download and extract [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) (tested with Tomcat 10).
2. **Copy the WAR file**  
   Move `target/tomcat-deployment.war` to Tomcat‚Äôs `webapps/` folder.
3. **Start Tomcat**
   - On Windows:  
     ```
     <tomcat-folder>/bin/startup.bat
     ```
   - On Linux/Mac:  
     ```
     <tomcat-folder>/bin/startup.sh
     ```
4. **Access the app**  
   Open [http://localhost:8080/tomcat-deployment/](http://localhost:8080/tomcat-deployment/) in your browser.

  - Ensure Tomcat is running and listening on port 8080.
  - Review Tomcat logs for errors.
- **Build errors?**  
  - Make sure you have Java 17+ and Maven installed.
  - Run `mvn clean package` from the project root.

## ‚ùì FAQ
**Q: Can I use a database for users?**  
A: Yes! Replace the hardcoded list in `UserService.java` with database logic.

**Q: How do I change the context path?**
